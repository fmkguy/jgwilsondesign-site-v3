                    <p><em>IndieRabbit</em> was a small web startup that offered a unique distribution platform for independent filmmakers and their audience members. It was my task to design a mascot for the company as well as to produce several illustrations for their marketing materials and site.</p>

                <h2 class="heading heading--beta">Character Design</h2>
                <p>There is <em>always</em> more to it than what&rsquo;s directly on the surface. When designing this character, for example, it&rsquo;s not just a matter of drawing a rabbit. You have to understand the personality of the character you&rsquo;re trying to create. And in the case of a mascot, that personality becomes or represents the personality of the whole company.</p>
                <p>Right at the start of the project, the team at <em>IndieRabbit</em> wanted a character that was a &ldquo;&hellip;classy, cool, and relatable rabbit that is a bit human&hellip;in a classic/graphic cartoon style.&rdquo;</p>

                <p>Even with all of the concept sketches I did, I still hadn&rsquo;t quite figured out the character (who we officially named Indy Rabbit). It wasn&rsquo;t until I started experimenting with facial expressions and refining from there that I really got a feel for &ldquo;who he is&rdquo;.</p>

                <p>But not all illustrations are created equal. The final illustration I completed was a large banner that they wanted to use as the first thing people saw when visiting the site. This single piece was really the culmination of everything I had done leading up to it. So I started it off with a teeny tiny thumbnail based on the direction I had received. (Fortunately for me, Jean-Marc, the co-founder and president of the company, was fantastic at giving direction. He knew what he wanted and gave me just enough freedom to make this one of my favorite projects of all time. So far.)</p>

                <p>The process was grueling. The tassels and carrots took what seemed an eternity to finish. And while the pencil stage is my favorite, I will never forget how sore my hand was from the endless hours of thoughtfully placing each line.</p>
                <p>But the results were worth every effort.</p>
